# Project Instruction

## Programming Tools
In our line of work, we need to understand both Pytorch and Tensorflow frameworks. Most people typically use only one in school. Hence part of the test is to see if you can pick up a book and learn the other framework quickly. In most cases, the code accompanying academic papers is in Pytorch. However, for industrial usage, we mostly use Tensorflow. Hence you must submit your code in Tensorflow and Python. I am sorry that Jax and Pytorch are NOT accepted. 

**Mandatory tools**: Python3, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Probability.

The code must be written in **Python 3** and **Tensorflow**. No other options are allowed. If you are not familiar with Tensorflow, *“Tensorflow in Action”* by **Thushan Ganegedara** is a good starting point for you. For Tensorflow Probability, a good book is *“Probabilistic Deep Learning: With Python, Keras and Tensorflow Probability”* by **Oliver Duerr**, **Beate Sick** and **Elvis Muriana**.

## Testing
Furthermore, it is important to test the validity of your implementation. Please ensure that you write unit tests and integration tests. It is absolutely critical to write tests. Omitting tests is going to automatically disqualify you. You may find this little article useful if you are not familiar with testing in Python: *https://realpython.com/python-testing/*. *“Python Testing with pytest: Simple, Rapid, Effective and Scalable”* 2nd Edition by **Brian Okken** may also be helpful for you. For the testing framework, we suggest you use unittest or pytest.

## Clean Code and Good Software Engineering
Strive for clarity and simplicity in your code. Use meaningful variable and function names and structure your code logically to enhance readability and maintainability. Furthermore, please ensure your code is well-documented in English and follow established docstring conventions *(such as PEP257 for python)*.   

Please write all comments and all documents in English.  Apply principles such as modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns. Avoid code duplication and write functions that do one thing well. Handle errors gracefully and validate inputs where appropriate. If you have not studied software engineering, you may find the books, *“Fluent Python: clear, concise and effective programming”* by **Luciano Ramalho** and *“Robust Python: Write Clean and Maintainable Code”* by **Patrick Viafore**, quite useful. Do follow the advice in the books.

## Guidelines
Choose one of the following four questions. Of course, you can try more than one of them and you will certainly be a star among the candidates. You can form teams to participate. Please see the teamwork section below. Here are the timeline and tasks for each project:
- 2 weeks after you receive this email, please email us to indicate if you are interested in attempting the exercise. Send us your GitHub address where you will upload your report and your code. 
  - If you are participating as a team, please ensure that all names of the team and a brief bio of each member are included.  
  - Please make your GitHub profile public so our team can review your code. **(By 23 December 2025)**
- 8 weeks after you receive this email, please email us and send us your codebase on part 1 as well as a brief report **(By 3 Feb 2026)** . The report should include:
  1. A literature review of potential methods for solving the problem.
  2. Propose your choice of methods and the reason for the choice.
  3. Present the answers to the question in clear and understandable language.
  4. Testing plans and testing results that show your implementation is correct and your results are valid. 
- 16 weeks after you receive this email, please email us and send us the final code and your final report for both part 1 and part 2. **(By 28 April 2026)**

## Teamwork
We do welcome teams of two or three candidates to work on the question(s) together. Each person gets a score of **(1 + 30%) * score of the question(s) / number of members in the team**. 

Each question is scored according to **literature survey (10%)**, **mathematical formulation and report (20%)**, **correctness of the solution (25%)**, **coding style and testing (20%)**, **creativity and entrepreneurship (25%)**. You must pass every part to pass. Each bonus question can provide an extra 75% of the score.  

Any individual (or teams) can attempt multiple questions. For those forming teams to take part in this challenge, please write a few paragraphs explaining which part of the work is joint work, which part is done by a specific individual. Please estimate the relative contribution of each member to the final result. During the interview, roughly 70% and the more difficult questions are on your part, and 30% on other areas of your team.
